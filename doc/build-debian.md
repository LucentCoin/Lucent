# Lucent Core v0.12.3.3 Setup Debian + Masternode Setup #
## Introductory ##

Welcome to the Lucent Core v0.12.3.3 Masternode Setup! This document will try to teach you or at least guide you towards the right direction to running a Masternode on your Debian device, more inclined towards the Raspberry Pi.

If you do get lost at some point point throughout this document, feel free to contact the Lucent Core Community at the [Official Lucent Core Discord Server](https://discord.gg/28Vbdeq), or read up on the official documentation found both at the [Lucent Core Documentations](https://github.com/LucentCoin/Lucent/tree/master/doc) and [Lucent Sentinel GitHub](https://github.com/C1ph3r117/Lucent-Sentinel).

If the guide didn't ask you to read this part, feel free to ignore this section.

* Swap Memory
  * Swap memory can be very useful for Debian devices that do not have a lot of RAM and processing power to efficiently run complex programs. By adding swap memory to your system, it will enable the ability to run more complex programs without running out of memory. Of course, there is a downside to swap memory, so we do not recommend going over 2x the amount of RAM you already have. Swap memory can only be done if you have enough space on your system.
